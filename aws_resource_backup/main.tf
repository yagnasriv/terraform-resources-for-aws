### Here's an example of how to create an EBS snapshot resource in Terraform:
### To create backups or snapshots of EBS volumes associated with your EC2 instances using Terraform, 
# you would typically use the aws_ebs_snapshot resource


resource "aws_ebs_snapshot" "example_snapshot" {
  volume_id = "vol-07b9f8e7277bbc5f4"  # Replace with your EBS volume ID
  tags = {
    Name = "MyBackup-YV"
  }
}
