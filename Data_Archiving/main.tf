### Data archiving in AWS often involves using services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier. 
### While Terraform doesn't directly manage data archiving within resources, 
### it can be used to set up the initial configurations for archiving policies, lifecycles, and policies 
### that determine when data should be archived. 


## Below is an example of how you can use Terraform to configure data archiving using an Amazon S3 bucket and Glacier:


provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_bucket" {
  bucket = "s3-bucket-name-yv"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "example_lifecycle" {
  rule {
    id      = "example-archive-rule"
    status  = "Enabled"

    prefix = ""

    transitions {
      days          = 30  # Archive to Glacier after 30 days
      storage_class = "GLACIER"
    }

    expiration {
      days = 365  # Permanently delete after 365 days in Glacier
    }
  }

  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example_bucket.id
}
